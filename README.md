# TerrariaButBadder
 Mistranslation mod for Terraria

How to Install:
	First you will need this program:
	https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/localization-packer-unpack-and-repack-terraria-translation-files.61972/
	
	Run it, and make sure the "Terraria's Location" field is correct.
	Then point the "repack folder" field to the 'memes' folder you downloaded
	Then press "Repack"
	Once in game, make sure to change your language to "Memes are here"
	
	The script used to do this can be found at https://github.com/badBlackShark/meme-translator/tree/7b238da6989a253befebc4e35c2d83ffdb1f2ae4
	Many thanks to my friend "BadBlackShark" for making all of this possible, without his help, I would have given up doing this manually within a minute!
